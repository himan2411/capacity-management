Automating the process of calculating fitment % based upon different parameters from demand.

How it helps to solve the problem?
    Until now this process for manual and even with a slight change in request parameter the entire effort could be a rework but with matching algorithm in place to do the lousy work it automates the entire effort of calculating fitment % based upon request params of the entire supply pool and catego
